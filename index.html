<p>While New York City is far from the only place experiencing a housing crisis, as one of the most expensive places to live, the effects are being exacerbated by rising housing prices and limited vacant public housing units. With the upcoming mayoral election, there is potential for changes in housing costs, limited availability, and improved conditions in NYCHA housing.</p>

<div class="container icon">
    <img src ="waitinginline.jpg" alt="People waiting in line">

<p>There are currently over 312,00 authorized residents living in NYCHA public housing, according to the <a href = "https://www.nyc.gov/assets/nycha/downloads/pdf/NYCHA_Fact_Sheet.pdf"> 2024 fact sheet</a>. This accounts to over 147,000 families, 2,365 of which are Section 8 families. As of December 2023, 241,178 families are on the waiting list, including 8,269 who are on the waiting list for Section 8 and 2,637 who are on the waiting list for both. However, there are only 6,149 vacant units reported on NYCHA’s website, although Gothamist <a href ="https://gothamist.com/news/nycha-has-nearly-6k-vacant-apartments-lawmakers-want-to-know-why"> reports</a> the number is actually closer to 8,600.</p>

<p>A <a href= "https://www.henleyglobal.com/publications/wealthiest-cities-2025/worlds-most-expensive-cities">report</a> by Henley & Partners names New York City as the second most expensive city in the world, after Monaco. And the data backs this claim up: The median asking rent in NYC was $4,080 in August 2025, according to <a href= "https://streeteasy.com/blog/data-dashboard/"> data</a> by StreetEasy, compared to the median asking rent nationwide of $1,494 according to the U.S. Census Bureau. A decade ago, the median asking rent around the same time was $2,950. As prices rise, so do property taxes for homeowners. Property tax rates for Class 1 residential properties (1-3 family homes) is 20.085%. For Class 2 properties (rentals, condo, and co-ops), property tax is 12.500%. In 2015, Class 1 properties paid 19.554%, while Class 2 properties paid 12.883%.</p>

<p>Both Democratic mayoral candidates outline plans to combat the housing affordability crisis. Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani has promised to freeze rent for all stabilized tenants, and plans to build 200,000 rent-stabilized homes over the next 10 years. He also vows to crack down on “bad landlords,” ensuring that NYC tenants not only have affordable housing, but high-quality housing as well. Former governor Andrew Cuomo has plans to build more housing across all income levels, claiming that more housing will ultimately lead to reduced rents. He also wants to use public land for housing developments, improve NYCHA conditions, and secure tenant rights.</p>

<p> So what are some steps that can be taken to ease the affordability crisis and get New Yorkers into housing? New Yorkers have some ideas:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/articles/2023/how-new-york-city-can-make-housing-more-affordable.html">Reform zoning laws:</a> relaxing regulations for development in areas near transit stations</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/articles/2023/how-new-york-city-can-make-housing-more-affordable.html">Streamlining development:</a> the less money that goes into building permit and approval processes, the more money that goes into housing, which in turn lowers housing costs</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/articles/2023/how-new-york-city-can-make-housing-more-affordable.html">Converting office buildings into residentials:</a> a tax relief program could encourage owners to convert offices into homes</li>
    <li><a href="https://council.nyc.gov/data/homeless/">Increasing city rental assistance vouchers to market rate:</a> voucher holders will be able to find stable and affordable housing</li> 
    <li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/16/nyregion/nyc-affordable-ideas.html">Revamping property tax rates to reflect real market values:</a> rental buildings pay less in taxes, which in turn can lead to lower rents</li>
</ul>
